We are going to build a Star Quiz application. The goal is an interactive
  star field viewer with a quiz mechanic.

  The hyg star database is available at ~/codeberg/wrightmikea/hyg - this is a
  liberally-licensed star catalog with over 100,000 stars including position,
  magnitude, distance, and proper names.

  The application should:
  1. Display a star field with stars as white circles of varying diameter
     (based on magnitude/brightness)
  2. Be draggable and zoomable
  3. Have an optional grid overlay toggle
  4. Quiz mechanic: Click a star → popup with multiple-choice star names
     (radio buttons, correct name + 3 nearby/similar stars, random order)
  5. Immediate feedback: green checkmark "Correct" or red X "Incorrect"
  6. Track success rate
  7. Controls panel on the right side
  8. Done button to show results and reset

  Start by exploring the hyg database to understand the schema and identify
  which fields we'll need for the quiz application.
